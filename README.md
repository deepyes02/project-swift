## Let's learn some Swift ##


At this point I am just lost. I'm coding merely to learn something new. XCode always came off to me as overwhelming and made me feel small. After about 5 years in Web development,
I have learned to tackle most UI related problems in frontend. Of course simple backend tasks have been handled too. 

This project follows documentation on : https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/swiftui/ , 

So there is not much to describe. 


However, I have made sure the code are working well at each checkpoints 'commits'. 


### Basic Learning as follows ###

1. Initiating a Swift Project in XCode.
2. Understanding the XCode Interface.
3. Clearly we don't need to import classes and properties created and just use in another file, which is quite different from functional programming languages.
4. We create new swift file based on whether they are UI or simple files like model.
5. Importing Json data and using it.
6. Importing assets (images) and using them.
7. Linking page navigations.
8. Dynamically displaying data (e.g list of places provided as arrays in the json file).
9. Understanding Swift code syntaxes and terminologies, althought this project mostly contains Swift UI codes. 


As I said, following the official tutorial might be more useful. Not sure if anyone is looking for a swift developer !

Hello world !
